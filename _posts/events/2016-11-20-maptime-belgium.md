We want to make open mapping easy! Watch this space to stay tuned for mapmaking activities all over Belgium, mostly in Brussels.

Most of us are involved in OpenStreetMap. We're the people behind [osm.be](http://osm.be/), [@osm_be](https://twitter.com/osm_be), [OSM Belgium on Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/OpenStreetMap-Belgium/) and the [Belgian OSM Newsletter](http://osm.us13.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=cc6632a49e784f67574e50269&id=5c2416bba6).

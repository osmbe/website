The day before SOTM Brussels, there's the HOT summit. You should go to both :)
After the HOT-summit, their participants are invited to come map with us. So expect plenty mappers who are deeply involved in humanitarian mapping.

We will need volunteers to help out beginners, as we will open to the public too. But it is also your chance for some networking. And we will have a validating-focused session, so come prepared to take the next step in your mapping career.

If you don't want any responsibilities and just bring your computer and do some mapping, please don't register here -register at the eventbrite: <https://www.eventbrite.com/e/missing-maps-hot-sotm-msf-tickets-26740573776>

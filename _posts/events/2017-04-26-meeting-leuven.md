The 300 participants of the National Mapathon managed to get a lot of work done. Those tasks need to be reviewed and either corrected and validated. Or they should be rejected and feedback sent to the mappers, so they can learn from the experience.

Don't worry, if you don't have any mapping experience, everything will be explained from the ground up and there are always projects on tasks.hotosm.org that are easy to map.

Everybody with an interest in mapping on OpenStreetMap.org is welcome to participate.

We'll be mapping using the JOSM editor in a fully equipped computer room.

You can bring your own laptop too. Please have the latest version of Java installed in that case.

We'll also discuss mapping our own local environment and how anybody can contribute to the map by making horizontal imagery (a sequence of geotagged pictures made with a smartphone using Mapillary or OpenStreetCam).

Then we'll have a look at how to make use of all that data by installing OsmAND or Maps.ME apps on your smartphones.

We'll discuss what OpenStreetMap related topics to discuss during the next meetup, as we're planning for this Meetup to be the first in a series organised on a monthly basis.

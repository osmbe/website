Open bike data and maps are part of the **solution towards more bike-friendly cities**. The good thing is... you as a citizen can **help improve these data and maps**!

On July 21st, [Open Knowledge Belgium](http://www.openknowledge.be/) is organizing in partnership with the Brussels-Capital Region and [OpenStreetMap Belgium](http://www.osm.be/), a **full-day event of talks and workshops** on how to create, edit and share open bike data and maps with [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). This event aims to gather all different actors in the fields of open bike data and maps and is **absolutely open to everyone** who wants to learn more about these topics.

**Come and join us to learn, meet and discuss the power of open knowledge!**

This event is organized by Open Knowledge Belgium, in partnership with the Brussels-Capital Region and OpenStreetMap Belgium, as part of its [open Summer of code 2017](http://2017.summerofcode.be/). Open Summer of Code is a 4-week program in July during which development, design, business and communication students transform open innovation projects into powerful real-world services.

During this year's edition of open Summer of code, 2 student teams will be working for the Brussels-Capital Region on the integration and validation of [open bike data](http://data-mobility.brussels/) in OpenStreetMap and the development of a mobile website for the Brussels cycling network. Both projects will also be presented on July 21st. See you then!

We get together to discuss OpenStreetMap.org and related topics. 

This time we talk about how to render a map from OpenStreetMap data. I will use "Pad van Ad" in Heverleebos/Meerdaalwoud as an example for exploring the possibilities of Maperitive, maybe QGIS too.

There are 7 computers and a projector available. There are also login codes for the wireless network, if you prefer to bring your own computer.

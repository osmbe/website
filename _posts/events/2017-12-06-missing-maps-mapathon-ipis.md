If you can't attend the Missing Maps mapathon at MSF the week before, if Brussels is a little far for you or if you just can't get enough, here's another chance to contribute to OSM in developing countries and/or pass the passion to new volunteers: IPIS is hosting another Mapathon in Antwerp!

We'll map various regions in Africa, with a special focus on the Okapi National Park in DRCongo.

IPIS staff has organisation covered but we're actively looking for validators and people who want to give a small presentation on fieldwork they did or special OSM tools (writing something in the comments then!).

Bring laptop & mouse. Drinks & snacks are on the house.

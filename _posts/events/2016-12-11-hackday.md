Ben Abelshausen and Glenn Plas would like to invite you to the OpenStreetMap Hackday!

The most important thing we will work on is the preparation of the GRB buildings import. We'll work on the final technical challenges, conceptual choices and documenting the process to get Data Working Group approval.

We propose Sunday, December 11th. We're still looking for a place to organize this, but we're aiming for something in or near Brussels, close to a big railway station.

There are many other things on our wishlist too:

- Finalizing the new OSM.be website. A chance to learn some Markdown, and we'll need translating help!
- The monolingual basemaps of Belgium Jonathan BeliÃ«n (jbelien) is working on
- PostgreSQL to osmose for Urbis actualisation (Marc Ducobu) and road improvement
- Use case for <http://tasks.osm.be/>
- ...

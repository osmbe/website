**Let's build a community with everybody interested in OpenStreetMap!**

The target audience is everybody! From hearing the word OpenStreetMap a few seconds ago to the total expert in no time. There will be someone you can discuss and have a drink with weâ€™re an interational community speaking English, Dutch, French so come join us!

Tell us what you'd like discuss/present/share.

We piggyback on Civics Lab Brussels hack nights. So apart from mappers, there will be also talks about air quality. However, there will be time for questions too! So new mappers, be welcome!

PS: if you want to map or try stuff, bringing your own laptop can be usefull.

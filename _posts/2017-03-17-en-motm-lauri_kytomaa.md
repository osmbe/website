## When and how did you discover OpenStreetMap? 

I came across the Osm website in 2007, but I didn't yet have a GPS and
there was only landsat imagery, if I remember correctly. Near the end
of 2008 I found a Garmin on sale, and remembered the osm site. After
just a few gps tracks I was hooked, there was so much to improve in my
home town, and in the meantime they had acquired the right to use
Yahoo imagery, which was already usable, even if it had arbitrary
distortions.

Quite soon after I had improved the road alignments near me, I
realised the potential for entering all the possible interesting but
non-obvious details of features, from [start_date](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:start_date)=* to [taxon](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:taxon)=* and
[turn:lanes](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:turn:lanes)=* to [building:maintenance:operator](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/building%3Amaintenance%3Aoperator#overview)=* (companies that to the
daily maintenance of buildings leave a sticker on the front door). The
possibilities are endless, and one can always find their own niche in
Osm.

## What do you map? 

I used to map the areas I lived and studied in, on foot and in a car,
going around taking hundreds of photos each time, and using several
days to enter all the features I could possibly extract from the
photos taken in just a few hours. In recent years, mapping has become
more of a thing to do if I have spare time, but if I visit new places,
I still try to spend some effort in taking good-for-mapping photos.
And a traffic camera on our car has changed my mapping, new journeys
get archived and I always have some videos I could go through.

# How do you map? 

I do almost all of my editing with JOSM. This year I've been fortunate
to hit the start of the busy years of personal life, so surveys for
the sake of surveying aren't on the top of my to do list, but I try to
incorporate surveying to any trips I take.

The gps on my current mobile phone seems worse than on the previous
phone, but here in [Finland](http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/54224) we now have suitably licenced state
provided imagery which is properly rectified. This means that I can
usually get the details accurate enough with just imagery combined
with photos/video, but I wouldn't consider myself and armchair mapper,
because mostly I don't have the time to work on areas I haven't
visited in person recently.

## How do you conduct your surveys? 

In short: with a dog.

I've tried several methods over the years, and by now I believe I know
how to choose the best method for each case with two main
considerations: how much time I expect to have available for entering
the data, and how soon I expect to revisit the area. Other things to
consider are the availability of good aerial imagery and the level of
detail already present.

If I were to do a survey of a limited area I hadn't mapped previously,
I'd still go for the method of gps + hundreds of photos; tilting the
camera consistently to the left or the right when I shoot left or
right to keep track of the direction. When doing a photoshoot survey,
there's no such thing as too much photos. I try to get a photo of all
the house numbers, staircase letters, roadside amenities, traffic
signs, building levels, lowered curbs and fences, to name just a few.

# Where do you map? 

Mostly I try to watch for local changes, and to slowly expand the
somewhat complete areas of my favourite tags when walking the dog, but
I also map on domestic and international trips, although then I
usually don't take detours anymore to get more data - that extra raw
data would just consume disk space. I did spend a week or two tracing
for the very first [Haiti activation](https://www.hotosm.org/projects/haiti-2) - being a student at that time it
was possible - but after that I've traced maybe three squares from
different [HOT tasking manager jobs](http://tasks.hotosm.org/). So I'm mostly a local mapper, but
I've touched the map in various places globally.

## What is your biggest achievement as mapper? 

Beside the moments when somebody proposed on the mailing lists, IRC or
wiki, that we should map some feature others haven't considered
worthwile, and I can say "I mapped those like years ago, it's quite
fun to map those". But if it has to be something I've entered on the
map, the first thing that comes to mind has to be uninterrupted
[lit](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:lit)=yes/no tag on a 600 km journey - before I had video. Or the time I
extrapolated houses in one area (which was then without aerial
imagery) from hundreds of photos by calculating distance estimates
from the sizes of the buildings in the photos, i.e. manual
photogrammetry.

## Why do you map? What motivates you? 

Mapping in places where locals are just starting out with the details,
I enjoy pushing their sense of map completeness by doing small areas
way further than one would expect, so that mappers just might realise
all the possibilities for detail and accuracy that can be achieved -
and maybe they'll figure out how the "first pass" mapping helps them
to do the details later, as opposed to first drawing so crude data
that it just gets in the way.

In the home territory keeping up to date with the changes is somewhat
satisfying, but more fun can be found in mapping stuff that requires
extra attention and deduction of facts from the surveyed details, like
the district heating network, or the major water pipes. To do those as
good as they can be, one has to be confident that they've mapped the
whole area down to the last patch of pavement, and that they have
entered all the details - and even then the map can be improved when
the utility company digs up the street to do repairs.

## What is the most difficult part of mapping? 

It has to be letting go of good source data and moving on to the next
picture or minute of video, when I have to choose between missing
basic tags on the next source and detailed tags on the current.

## What are your mapping plans for the near future? 

I have weeks or months worth of traffic camera videos from our car,
and just entering paved:date=* tags for this year's freshly repaved
roads would be near the top of the to do list - after finishing with
the honeymoon photos from [Santorini](http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/453964). Completing all the traffic signs
for my home town [Helsinki](http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/34914) is a primary long term goal, another active
mapper is almost finished with the house numbers and we have a shared
svg file for tracking the areas we have claimed as
traffic-signs-complete.

## Do you have contact with other mappers? 

I have only twice met other mappers in person. There's an irc channel
local to Finland, with about 40 active idlers - yet we do discuss
there occasionally mapping and city planning issues (changes possibly
coming up that should be mapped). In the past we concluded that
mapping parties didn't really work here: mappers meet, move around
alone or in pairs to do their surveys, meet again shortly and go home
to input their new data.

Only quite recently some seem to have been organising pub meetings,
but so far I've thought that in general the time's better spent doing
actual mapping - especially now that other important real life
activies require more attention than before.

## Do you use OpenStreetMap yourself? How? 

Virtually always when I have to get routing on my mobile phone, I use
something based on OSM data. Occasionally, if I need to send map links
to someone, I might link to the relevant element on the osm main
website data layer. Sometimes I've used JOSM in a not-intented-way to
draw some crude map illustrations (like comparisons of some areas)
over an osm background, for the lack of a better software, and then
saved those as cropped screenshots.

I used to use an old Nüvi for making tracks, but the battery on that
died a long time ago; it did work for routing with converted osm data
on international travels, in countries for which the device didn't
have any maps by default.

## Do you do anything else than mapping that is related to OpenStreetMap? 

Years ago I started working on a Josm plugin, even got it working  on a proof of concept stage, but soon after that somebody else
released the far more advanced routing plugin. I've done a fair share
of translating of Josm's texts to Finnish, and I used to be quite
active on the Osm wiki, both in English and Finnish, back when there
were so little changes that I could read just about all changes each
day through the recent changes page. Following the wiki started to
take so much time that it was delaying mapping, so I had to virtually
stop reading the wiki.


## To conclude, is there anything else you want to mention? 

OSM is about original research and local knowledge. If you can and
want to keep it up to date, you should enter it. Other maps may have
the same map features, but OSM knows more about everything.

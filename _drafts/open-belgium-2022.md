Every year, the open data / open source / open knowledge community of Belgium meet during the Open Belgium conference. There's a lot of people we haven't seen since 2019. This year on April 29th, Open Belgium will be a real life event again. We hope to see you in Ghent!

We will be there with a stand, talks & workshops and [post-event drinks](https://www.meetup.com/OpenStreetMap-Belgium/events/284091798/). If you have an idea submit it yourself or ask for advice (deadline: March 21st).

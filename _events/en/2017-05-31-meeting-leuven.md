We can work on a task from <http://tasks.hotosm.org>.

Or we can do some local mapping. Please write under reactions (in Meetup page) what is your preference.

From 2-4th of June I'll go to SotM-FR in Avignon to present a workshop about mapping Public Transport. So I'll probably have a presentation ready about that topic. But we don't have to tackle such an advanced and somewhat specialised topic.

Everybody with an interest in mapping on OpenStreetMap.org is welcome to participate.

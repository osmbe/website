We get together to discuss OpenStreetMap.org and related topics.

There are 7 modern computers to work on and there is a projector available. There are also login codes for the wireless network, so please bring your own laptop.

There have been 3 hurricanes in the caribbean, an earthquake in Mexico and floods in Niger, Uganda and Nepal. Maybe we can have a mini mapping party again to help out.

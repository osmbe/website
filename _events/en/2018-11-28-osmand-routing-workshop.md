Zeus WPI - the student working group of UGent - has invited me to give a small workshop on tweaking the routing engine of OsmAnd. After a small introduction, we'll try to get the things working on our phones.

This meetup is geared toward people with some technical background. You've should at least have edited an XML file before and know what a tag-value pair on OSM is.

Bring
- Your computer
- Your phone with a working version of OsmAnd
- A micro-USB cable to transfer files to your phone

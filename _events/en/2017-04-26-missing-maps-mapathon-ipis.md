**NGOs working in the South need decent maps in order to reach people who need help. However, in many places the map is not yet complete.**

That's why we need your help!

We teach volunteers like you how to trace satellite imagery into OpenStreetMap, a free and open map of the entire world. Together, we'll put an entire area of Central Africa on the map in one evening. No experience required!

Bring laptop & mouse. Drinks & snacks are on the house.

We'll map various regions in Africa, with a special focus on the Okapi National Park in DRCongo.

You'll have the opportunity to learn how to map, hear about some projects in the field and chat with other participants and researchers of the International Peace Information Service (IPIS).

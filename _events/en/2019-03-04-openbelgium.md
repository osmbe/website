**Let's make Belgian knowledge open, usable, used, useful**

Open Belgium is an annual Open Knowledge and Open Data conference gathering **industry, research, government and citizen stakeholders**. In other words, anyone who is interested in Open Knowledge and Open Data is more than welcome!

We aim to bring you up to speed with the latest trends, innovations and best practices by sharing experiences among this wide range of participants. Get inspired by high-level keynote speakers, engaging panel discussions, hands-on and minds-on workshops as well as the interactive exhibition space where a multitude of partners present innovative products, services and research.

Since the event is **community-driven**, you can influence the conference program. How? By responding to the open call for proposals, which is published on our website until January 13. A selection committee will then decide on the remaining tracks and lineup.

Your proposal didn't get selected? No worries, we will provide an open space for lightening talks to give everyone the chance to share their ideas.

If this sparked your interest, **join us on March 4 in Brussels** and join the open community! Check out our [website](http://www.openbelgium.be/) for more information and feel free to join the Twitter conversation via [#openbelgium19](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=openbelgium19). Your voice matters!

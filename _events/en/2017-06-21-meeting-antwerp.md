**Let's build a community with everybody interested in OpenStreetMap!**

We'll be coming to get together again in the city of Antwerp and talk about OpenStreetMap and other interesting stuff with some beers or other beverages.

Everybody is welcome, whether you've been mapping for ten years, or you just encountered OpenStreetMap somewhere and you want to know more.

We're an international community and we speak Dutch, French and English, so come join us!

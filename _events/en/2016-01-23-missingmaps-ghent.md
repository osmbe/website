We'll map away somewhere deep in Africa with as many people as possible. RSVP here if you want to help out during the event. Experience iD and JOSM mappers very much needed.

If you just want to come map with us, book a place at this [Eventbrite page]<https://www.eventbrite.com/e/missing-maps-mapathon-gent-tickets-19951189545>.

More info at the OSM.be blog in Dutch or English.

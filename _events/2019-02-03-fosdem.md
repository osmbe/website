**FOSDEM is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate.**

Every year, thousands of developers of free and open source software from all over the world gather at the event in Brussels.

The Geospatial devroom is the place to talk about the state of the art of open, geo-related data, free and open source geospatial software and its ecosystem. This includes standards and tools, e.g. spatial databases, online mapping tools, geospatial services, used for collecting, storing, delivering, analysing, and visualizing geodata.

We will meet at 5PM (on Sunday) next to the geospatial devroom ! Join us !

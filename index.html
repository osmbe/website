		<p>Want to become part of our community? You probably already are!</p>

		<p>
			In short, everyone interested in OpenStreetMap in Belgium is part of our community. First of all we have our mappers. But
			we also have people volunteering in a range of activities, or helping with building software, organizing mapathons or
			help with other OpenStreetMap related events. Our goal is to make everyone feel welcome and if you are still reading
			this we probably already consider you part of our community.

		<h4>OpenStreetMap Belgium, our mission!</h4>
		<p>
			So, if everyone is part of the community then what's OpenStreetMap Belgium all about? Our main mission is to facilitate mapping
			activities in Belgium and make sure everyone feels welcome. You can call us 'crazy' about mapping, perhaps a bit more
			than the average community member. If you want to help to improve and grow the mapping community in Belgium, to make
			even more people crazy about mapping, OpenStreetMap Belgium is the right place for you! Visit the 'join' page to become
			an official member.

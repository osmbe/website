# OSM BE Website

The new OpenStreetMap Belgium website.

The master branch is published to www.osm.be, the develop branch is pushlished to [develop.osm.be](http://develop.osm.be).

## Customizing the website

Feel free to customize the website content.

### Creating an new post

1. In the `_posts` directory, create a new Markdown file. Name the file in the pattern of `YYYY-MM-DD-language-slug.md`, where *YYYY-MM-DD* is the date of the event or post, *language* is the language of the post (`fr`, `nl`, `en` or `ge`) and *slug* is a short, unique identifier for post. For example, a post in English dated January 1, 2016 entitled "Mappy New Year" might be named `2016-01-01-en-mappy-new-year.md`.

2. At the top of the Markdown file, add *front matter* for your content type. Each post needs some extra information at the top of the file called [front matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/). The front matter determines what kind of content it is and other settings, like authorship or RSVP information. See the next section, _Content types_, for a listing of front matter options.

   Here's example front matter for a post:

   ```
   ---
   title: Missing Maps Mapathon at Doctors without Borders / Handicap International Brussels 
   featured: images/post/missing-maps.png
   layout: post
   author: Jorieke Vyncke
   lang: nl
   ---
   ```

3. Beneath the front matter, write your post text. You can format your text using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). For example:

   ```
   Artsen Zonder Grenzen (AZG) en Handicap International (HI) verwelkomen ons voor de volgende Missing Maps Mapathon. Kom en maak nieuwe kaarten met ons en samen met zij die de kaarten zullen gebruiken op het terrein! 
   ```

4. Preview your work with the "preview" tab.

5. Once you're satisfied with your new post, **Propose a new file** and then **Create pull request**. You pull request will be checked and merged to the website is everything is good.

In a few minutes, your post appears on website!

### Content Types

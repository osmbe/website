_Brice (eMerzh) lives in Jette. He is 30 and programmer in a small start-up in Brussels that is active in social analytics. He is passionate about open source and everything around it. For his job he works on Archlinux + KDE and his preferred OpenStreetMap editor is of course JOSM!_


**When and where did you discover OpenStreetMap?**

I discovered OpenStreetMap by accident in 2007, when it was mentioned on a website with Linux information, (http://linuxfr.org). I was attracted by the collaboration and open aspects of the project. I soon discovered that my street was not mapped yet and see... I was bitten by the bug.

**Do you use OpenStreetMap yourself?**

I regularly use OpenStreetMap for looking up information and visualising it on the internet. Sometimes I also use OsmAnd on a smartphone when I am abroad. But I have to confess that I still use Google Maps a lot, probably until OpenStreetMap and Mapillary have reached the same level.

**Which type of mapper are you?**

I have three faces:

* the occasional surveyor: during my holidays I often take notes to map later on. I also collect traces or take pictures for Mapillary.
* the mapper at distance: from my living room. I worked a lot on the Urbis import, but also in the southern part of Belgium.
* making corrections: I regularly use [Osmose](http://osmose.openstreetmap.fr/fr/) and [KeepRight](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/FR:Keep_Right) or just JOSM to correct errors.

Thus, I mainly map in Brussels, but also in the Southern part of Belgium.

**What do you map?**

I'm not specialized in something particular. I just would like to see that OpenStreetMap is used in the everyday life of a maximum of people with data as reliable (or even more reliable) as Google Maps. So I help a lot in mapping address information and information for routing like maximum speed, junctions, names, ...

**What is you biggest accomplishment as mapper?**

Accomplishment? I think that I did a rather large part of the Urbis import. Even if the work is not completely done yet, it still means that the majority of the addresses in Brussels are now mapped.

**Why do you map?**

Such a rich database, which is open and free to use by man and machines...

**Do you do other things for OpenStreetMap?**

I make some statistics here and there, and I developed the app [OpenFixMap](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenFixMap) (although I have to update it), but most of the time I just talk about it!

**Do you have contact with other mappers?**

I have only some contact with Julien Fastr√© and with some friends that also map (Hello Pollux! ), but that is it.

**Do you have ideas to let the OpenStreetMap community grow?**

I think we should really go for "gamification". Applications such as MapRoulette are a good start. However, I am thinking more about things like Ingres or Waze. Pushing people to contribute, without really mapping.

**How do you stay up-to-date with OpenStreetMap?**

Thanks to the mailing lists, my RSS-feed, twitter... I think I'm aware of what is going on.

**What is the biggest strength of OpenStreetMap?**

The fact that the data is free, the flexibility of the schema and the unlimited possibilities to add data.

**What is the biggest challenge for OpenStreetMap?**

It might be a problem to keep attracting contributors, real ones, not just accounts. Another challenge is to standardise as much tags as possible without limiting the extendibility. The project [Tag Central](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/SotM_2010_session:_Tag_Central:_a_Schema_for_OSM) can I find very interesting in this point of view. The addition of 2.5d/3D might also pose some challenges.

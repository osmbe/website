## Hello Domenico ! Would you like to briefly introduce yourself to our readers?

I am 60 years old, married and the father of a girl. I live in Ravenna (Italy).

## How and when did you get to know OpenStreetMap?

I met OpenStreetMap in 2011 during a Linux party.

## How do you use OpenStreetMap?

I use OpenStreetMap as a simple contributor who might need it in some way.

## What kind of contributor are you and in which area do you map?

I was a not very active contributor until 2016 while, after that, I had more time on my hands and since 2017 I have been contributing more actively. Currently the main areas I map are the province of Agrigento in Sicilia.

## What are you mapping? Do you have a specialisation?

The area I am mapping is the city of Aragona, which was not mapped in OpenStreetMap in 2016. I have knowledge of topography because of my military profession and because I graduated as a surveyor.

## What is your greatest achievement as mapper?

Having found that large groups such as Google Maps have sometimes copied my work, I have included errors in some areas (known only to me) promptly reported, subsequently removed them.

## Why are you mapping? What motivates you?

I map because I have a lot of free time and for the satisfaction of being useful to those who need it, especially tourists who want to visit particularly interesting areas of Sicily.

## Do you have any ideas to expand the OpenStreetMap community, to motivate more people to contribute?

Make a link with data collection applications such as Street Complete, useful e.g. by joggers, for both simple users and leisure associations, [Pro Loco](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Loco) and those that generally promote the area.

## Do you have contact with other mappers?

At the moment no, if there are any JOSM experts I would be very happy to make their acquaintance.

## What is in your view the greatest strength of OpenStreetMap?

The simplicity of contribution.

## What are the largest challenges for OpenStreetMap?

Becoming the world's largest geographic database and being able to innovate in simplicity.

## How to do stay on top of news about OpenStreetMap?

It would be good if comments from contributing users were grouped by topic and also translated into Italian.

## To conclude, is there anything else you want to share with the readers?

At the moment, I think that will be enough. I remain at your disposal, greetings to the entire OpenStreetMap team.

**Thank you, Domenico, for this interview.**

In September 2022 our Corporate Member Anyways.eu invited us to share their booth at the [Trefdag Digitaal Vlaanderen](https://www.vlaanderen.be/trefdag-digitaal-vlaanderen) (NL). We had a blast! All day long, people from the geo world, from the private sector and the government came by to ask questions, thank us for our work or simply chat with the people behind the map.

For the occasion, we finally made some promo material. Inspired by a French project, we made "business cards" that you can use when you explain OSM to a place you just put on the map. We also created a leaflet explaining our most important projects.

If you want to have a few copies of both document, let us know. If you have ideas for better designs - we can use all the help we can get! Thanks to our Corporate Membership program, we can make more promo material.

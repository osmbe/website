Our member Pieter Vander Vennet is the main developer of [MapComplete](https://openstreetmap.be/en/projects/mapcomplete.html). Most of the core of the project was made during several paid projects. Now, Pieter has received significant funding from [NlNet](https://nlnet.nl/), which allows him to work half-time on MapComplete for the coming year. Many improvements to the user interface are to be expected. You can follow the progress on the [Github pages](https://github.com/pietervdvn/MapComplete/issues). There is already some interesting research [on his diary](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Pieter%20Vander%20Vennet/diary).

Most of us map just the things that interest us. But OpenStreetMap Belgium likes to focus on specific areas that we think can help the map forward in a significant way. [We've created a short list of topics](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Belgium/top_mapping_tasks) where we can use some help: mapping roads, buildings & addresses, the effects of traffic signs and improving long distance hiking trails are on there. All these projects should contain help to get you started, but don't hesitate to ask for help on any of our channels.

We've also updated the Road Completion tasks for Belgium: about 400 new road segments are being checked to make sure there are no roads the governement knows about that are missing in OSM. By now, almost all the tasks in Flanders are done, but there's a few hundred left [in this task for Wallonia](https://maproulette.org/browse/challenges/14681)!

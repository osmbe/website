## Support us

OpenStreetMap Belgium operates on a very small budget. Right now, we can afford to pay for our servers and an occasional train ticket.
With your donation, we aim to:

- Systematically refund transport costs for volunteers at events
- Give hi-viz vests to volunteer mappers
- Create promotional materials
- Give a volunteer fee to mappers who organize activities or join meetings with partners
- Larger donations will help us fund one or more of our [projects]({{< ref "projects" >}}) and help us professionalize our organization, for example to apply for subsidies and get more administrative and communication support.

You can use the form below or make a wired transfer to the OpenStreetMap Belgium bank account : **BE42 5230 8154 5854**.  
Please add a note to the wire transfer stating that you are making a donation.

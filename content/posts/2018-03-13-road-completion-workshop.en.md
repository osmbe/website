## What we'll do

We found 13.000 missing roads in Flanders, Belgium! Help us map them with the tools we made. We'll teach you how to do it, and if you're interested tell you all about our plans with the project.
Check out <{{< ref "projects/road-completion.md" >}}> for more info

We're doing this during the Biweekly Civic Hack night, so you could work on some other projects too. See <https://www.meetup.com/Civic-Lab-Brussels/events/llcnsnyxdbkc/>

## What to bring

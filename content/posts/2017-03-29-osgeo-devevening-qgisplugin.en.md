For this OSGeoDevEvening we will explain how to extend QGis with your own plugins. 
Following a step-by-step process, we will create our own extension.

We will also dedicate some time to the upcoming QGis 3 releasing, due by the end of the summer. 
We'll highlight some of the new features waiting on your input and testing!

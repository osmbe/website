Let's meet in Namur for the next Wallonia OpenStreetMap meetup on the 27 May 2018 , 6:30 PM ! Anyone interested in OSM is welcome, from the absolute beginner to the most experienced mapper. Do not hesitate to come if you are just curious about OpenStreetMap and participatory cartography. We have booked a room at Mundo-N (Rue Nanon, 98, Namur, 10 min. from the station) with a beamer, so anyone interested can bring a laptop and present something. Thema of the day: OpenStreetMap and Hiking

Drinks & pizzas will be offered!

Let's meet in Namur for the next Wallonia OpenStreetMap meetup on the 12 Sept. 2017 night! Anyone interested in OSM is welcome, from the absolute beginner to the most experienced mapper. Do not hesitate to come if you are just curious about OpenStreetMap and participatory cartography. We can have a room at Mundo-N (Rue Nanon, 98, Namur, 10 min. from the station) with a beamer, so anyone interested can bring a laptop and present something. We plan to bring some drinks. We may go outside for some mobile applications demo/trial.

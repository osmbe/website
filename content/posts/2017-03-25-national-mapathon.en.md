## Help Doctors Without Borders and the Red Cross to facilitate their rescue

After a succesful event last year, a new national Mapathon will take place on Saturday, March 25th, which is organized by the National Committee for Geography, in collaboration with OpenStreetMap Belgium. Several universities in Brussels, Flanders and Wallonia open their doors a whole day for a large collective mapping event. Come contribute - do not miss this opportunity and help Doctors Without Borders and the Red Cross to facilitate their work in crisis areas.

In order to cope with crisis situations quickly and offer help efficiently, humanitarian agencies need maps. Hence, MSF and the Red Cross have joined forces in 2014 to launch the Missing Maps project, along with the OpenStreetMap Foundation. All over the world the project recruits volunteers to map areas where the risk of natural disasters, epidemics and conflicts is greatest.

We will provide you with a computer and an Internet connection, and that's all you need! It is not difficult. In no time you are working as a road mapper. The response to the project is large, the number of volunteers is growing worldwide, and increasingly mapping parties or mapathons organized where volunteers come together to map a larger area at once.

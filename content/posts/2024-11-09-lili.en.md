OpenStreetMap Belgium is organizing a mapathon in Bruges as part of our participation in the AMAI "[Lili-app project](https://amai.vlaanderen/projecten/project3-lili)". The Lili-app will help visually impaired people find and follow the best route using their smartphone. The app will take into account infrastructure such as sidewalks and pedestrian crossings and special facilities such as tactile paving and traffic lights with sound signals.

Initially, a prototype of the app will be developed that is limited to the city of Bruges. During the mapathon, we will add missing infrastructure to OpenStreetMap. Everyone is welcome. We help beginners take their first steps. There will also be more complex tasks for experienced mappers.

More info and registration via [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/openstreetmap-belgium/events/304083372/) or [OSMcal](https://osmcal.org/event/3228/). Catering is provided for all registered participants.
